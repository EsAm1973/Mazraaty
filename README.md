## üå± Vision

> "Mazraaty aims to bridge the knowledge gap for aspiring agriculturists and plant lovers.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication:** Register, log in, and manage your credentials securely to personalize your experience and access all app features. If you forget your password, you can easily recover and reset it through the app's password recovery process.
- **Educational Guidance:** Step-by-step support and tips for plant care and agriculture basics.
- **Library of Plants:** Explore a vast collection of plant species with detailed information, care methods, and common diseases.
